Printing buffer contents:

Compilers  are  fundamental  to  modern  computing.
They  act  as  translators,  transforming  human-oriented
language  into  computer-oriented  machine-language.
A compiler allows virtually all computer users to
ignore the  machine-dependent  details of machine language.
Isn't that nice?  -:)
